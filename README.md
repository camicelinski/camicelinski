## Welcome
I'm **Camila Montes Celinski**, a Brazilian architect based in Warsaw with experience in monuments and historical buildings. Currently I'm looking for a career change to work as a front-end developer. 

### Education
In the last year I took part in Akademia Samouka, a front-end course in which: 
- I was learning day by day for 9 full months - **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React and Redux**
- I completed 120 coding tasks by myself
- I coded 17 projects by myself

### Skills
In my previous jobs I was valued by the following skills:
- team work (my colleagues would describe me as friendly, empathetic and enthusiastic)
- organization, project management
- problem solving 
- design and artistic sense (which probably explains why I have a strong interest in UX/UI)
- diplomacy and knowledge of intercultural differences
- ability and willingness to learn new things (e.g. I learned to speak Polish from scratch)

### Currently
- I keep learning, especially React and Redux
- I'm looking for my first job experience in front-end development
